## Feedback and Data
We got some feedback about the design and UI of the page from the google form that we had set up, some saying that it was a little too basic, but there were also some people who appreciated that it was basic and easy to navigate. Most people also agreed that it was a useful project that they could use, just needed to be expanded and the practicality needed to be added, for example having data about the investments, like current stock price. People also wanted something more communal and where they could add comments and things like that, were tjere is more added interactions between the users directly.
I plan to implement some more about the community and allow the users to interact directly. We could have the page where the user can see their companies be able to lead to another page that allows for messaging.
## Reflection on Our Presentations
I think it was good that most people that we talked to were "techy" and we could practice discussing some of the coding aspects of the code, on top of pitching the general idea of our project.

## Blog on other work (CS and Other Classes)

I got here for the last N@TM shift, I was still able to see Orlando's project, a clone of Discord/Slack where users are able to chat in different channels, as well as a Chatbot to talk to if you have no friends

I was a former photography student as well, so I decided to go into the photo classroom, and I was impressed with all of the photos, especially the scenery and sports photos.
