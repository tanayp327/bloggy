- Make Lab Notebook rows/columns for each week 0, 1, 2. Make a hack (IPYNB) and review/exit ticket for each row. Review student page as guide Time Box, use Front matter and Jekyll system to create the page.
- Get my github.io public site running. This will work after GitHub sync. Here are some key references for GitHub: GitHub Sync
- Work on revising my IPYNB file(s) and add in my required Hacks. Learn how to do “Code Fencing”, “Code Cells”. Revise Linux Shell - Java Hello - Java Console Games IPYNB’s, prune and perform hacks to match my understanding.
- Revise Home Page to only be a Lab Notebook Cover sheet, Remove some of the content that I mistakingly put on this page regarding weekly plans and hacks …. move this information into my Lab Notebook rows/columns.
- Work on adding a Project, my choice will be a JS Calculator and I will add it as an independent _post that will be in Week1 hacks of my Notebook.
- Perform reviews on JS, specifically Inputs, Outputs, and APIs to be ready to support frontend on my future Java projects.
