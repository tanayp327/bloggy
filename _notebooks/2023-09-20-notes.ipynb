    "\n",
    "- Since me and Vishnu both went over 2d arrays, we decided to collabarate and give each other feedback\n",
    "- These are some questions Vishnu asked me to give me feedback: How does the representation of candies in a 2D array compare to real-world scenarios where grid-like structures are used, such as board games or seating arrangements? In the removeNextByFlavor method, the traversal starts from the last row. How would the method change if the traversal started from the first row? Further Exploration: How can the current implementation be extended to handle more complex scenarios, such as having multiple flavors or adding functionalities like sorting candies based on flavors? \n",
    "     - The 2D array representation of candies resembles real-world scenarios because its simple showing a box of candy with rows and columns and pieces of candies within a square of the grid.\n",
    "     - In the removeNextByFlavor method, if traversal started from the first row a different behavior in terms of which candy with the specified flavor is removed first, potentially prioritizing candies in the top rows.\n",
    "     - Implement sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quicksort, or merge sort to rearrange the candies based on their flavors. Maybe allow the user to put all the types of certain candy in a certain row/column.\n",
    "     - To add functionalities for more complex scenarios I could introduce a mapping of flavors to colors or types, adding more to the candy properties and sort based off of these properties as well\n",
    "- Here is some of the feedback I gave Vishnu: Your code is very close to the canonical solution, so there isn't much to change. I would just add the functionalities such as using additional data types, not just integers. You could also add a method to resize the 2D array to contain only the rows with all elements that are in a certain order, such as ascending or descending order.\n",
    "You could also implement more user interaction, such as the user inputting their own 2D array, and then resizing it based on certain values they want to filter out. If you do that, a change to an existing methods that I would like to see is handling null or faulty inputs."
