    "## Question 1 - Pojos and Access Control:\n",
    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO\n",
    "\n",
    "Private access controllers restrict access to class members within the same class but public access controllers allow unrestricted access from any other class, facilitating interaction with the class's members. For a POJO, using private access for fields with public accessor and mutator methods ensures controlled access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above\n",
    "\n",
    "You would use private access controllers for the class's fields like name, age, and address but you would use public access controllers for methods like getName(), getAge(), and getAddress(), allowing other classes to retrieve information about a person.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects\n"

    "\n",
    "2. **Fields (Instance Variables):**\n",

    "   - Fields define the attributes or properties associated with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constructors:**\n",
    "   - Create constructors to initialize objects of the class.\n",
    "   - Constructors have the same name as the class and may accept parameters to initialize object state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Methods:**\n",
    "   - Methods are for the logic associated with the class, such as calculations or interactions with other objects.\n",

    "Create a Java class BankAccount to represent a simple bank account. This class should have the following attributes:\n",

    "\n",
    "(a) Explain how a constructor works, including when it runs and what generally is done within a constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A constructor is as a special method responsible for initializing objects of a class. It works automatically when you create an object using the `new` keyword. When an object is instantiated, the constructor with the same name as the class is invoked, ensuring that the object starts with a defined initial state. Constructors facilitate the process of setting initial values to the object's fields, ensuring that the object is in a consistent and usable state right from its creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Create an example of an overloaded constructor within a class. You must use at least three variables. Include the correct initialization of variables and correct headers for the constructor. Then, run the constructor at least twice with different variables and demonstrate that these two objects called different constructors. "
