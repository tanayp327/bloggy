    "**Key Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key algorithms in the `SparseArray1` class involve accessing values at specific indices, removing columns from the sparse array, and displaying the sparse array. Let's analyze how these algorithms match the FRQ type of Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Structure:** Similar to the `SparseArray` class, the `SparseArray1` class encapsulates functionality related to sparse arrays. It contains instance variables to store the number of rows, number of columns, and a list of `SparseArrayEntry` objects representing non-zero elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instance Variables:** The class maintains instance variables `numRows`, `numCols`, and `entries`, similar to the `SparseArray` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Method Implementation:**\n",
    "   - `getValueAt(int row, int col)`: This method retrieves the value at the specified row and column in the sparse array. It iterates through the list of entries and returns the value associated with the matching entry. If no entry is found, it returns 0.\n",
    "   - `removeColumn(int col)`: This method removes the specified column from the sparse array. It iterates through the list of entries, removes entries with column indexes matching the given column, and decrements the column indexes of entries with column indexes greater than the specified column.\n",
    "   - `display()`: This method displays the sparse array by iterating over each row and column and printing the corresponding values. It utilizes the `getValueAt` method to retrieve values at specific indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Instance Methods:** All three methods (`getValueAt`, `removeColumn`, `display`) are instance methods that operate on specific instances of the `SparseArray1` class. They utilize the instance variables of the class to access and manipulate the sparse array."
