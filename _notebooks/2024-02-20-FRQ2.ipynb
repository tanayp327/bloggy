    "After a guess is made, the player is given a hint that is based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess. Each position in the hint contains a character that corresponds to the letter in the same position in the guess. The following rules determine the characters that appear in the hint.\n",

    "A table is shown with two columns titled If the letter in the guess is... on the left and the corresponding character in the hint is on the right. The first row reads also in the same position in the hidden word on the left, and the matching letter on the right. The second row reads also in the hidden word but in a different position on the left, and a plus sign on the right. The third row reads not in the hidden word on the left, and an asterisk on the right.\n",

    "\n",
    "The key algorithm in the `HiddenWord` class revolves around generating hints for a guessing game based on a given guess and the hidden word. Let's analyze how this algorithm matches the FRQ type of Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Structure:** The `HiddenWord` class is appropriately designed to encapsulate the functionality related to the hidden word and generating hints. It contains a constructor to initialize the hidden word and a method `getHint` to produce hints based on guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instance Variables:** The class maintains an instance variable `hiddenWord` to store the hidden word provided during object creation. This ensures that the hidden word is accessible within the class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Method Implementation:** The `getHint` method implements the logic to compare a guess with the hidden word and generate hints accordingly. It traverses both strings character by character, determining if characters match or if they appear in different positions, and constructs the hint string accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Instance Method:** The `getHint` method is an instance method that operates on a specific instance of the `HiddenWord` class. It utilizes the instance variable `hiddenWord` to generate hints based on the provided guess."
