    "\n",
    "This question involves reasoning about one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of integers. You will write three static methods, all of which are in a single enclosing class, named DiverseArray (not shown). The first method returns the sum of the values of a one-dimensional array; the second method returns an array that represents the sums of the rows of a two-dimensional array; and the third method analyzes row sums.\n",

    "A table is shown with two columns, arr 1 on the left and Value returned by arraySum open parentheses arr 1 close parentheses. In the left column an array is shown.

The method has one parameter, a two-dimensional array arr2D of int values. The array is in row-major order: arr2D [ r ] [ c ] is the entry at row r and column c. The method returns a one-dimensional array with one entry for each row of arr2D such that each entry is the sum of the corresponding row in arr2D.

    "**Key Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm implemented in the `isDiverse` method of the `DiverseArray` class matches the FRQ type of Array/ArrayList and 2D Array. Let's break down how the algorithm aligns with this FRQ type:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Array/ArrayList Usage:** The algorithm primarily operates on arrays. It utilizes a one-dimensional array to store row sums and then traverses through this array to check for duplicates. This demonstrates proficiency in handling arrays effectively, which is a key aspect of Array/ArrayList FRQs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **2D Array Handling:** The algorithm receives a two-dimensional array as input and computes the sums of each row. It then examines these sums to determine whether they are diverse. This showcases competence in manipulating and processing 2D arrays, which is a fundamental skill in dealing with such FRQs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Control Structure:** The algorithm employs nested loops to iterate through the row sums array and compare each sum with every other sum, checking for duplicates. This demonstrates mastery of control structures, specifically nested loops, to perform iterative tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Method Abstraction:** The `isDiverse` method encapsulates the logic for determining array diversity, providing a clean and reusable solution. This exemplifies the use of methods for modularizing code and promoting code maintainability and readability."
