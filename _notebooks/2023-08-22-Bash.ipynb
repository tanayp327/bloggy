      "The materials, such as this README, as well as `Tools`, `DevOps`, and `Collaboration` resources are integral part of this course and Computer Science in general.  Everything in our environment is part of our learning of Computer Science. \n",
      "- `Visual Studio Code` is key the code-build-debug cycle editor used in this course, [VSCode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  This is an example of a resource, but inside of it it has features for collaboration.\n",
      "- `Tech Talks`, aka lectures, are intended to be interactive and utilize `Jupyter Notebooks` and Websites.  This is an example of blending instruction and tools together, which in turn provide additional resources for learning.  For instance, deep knowledge on  GitHub Pages and Notebooks are valuable in understanding principles behind Full Stack Development and Data Science. \n",

      "\n",
      "Development Cycle. For GitHub pages, the tooling described below will create a development cycle  `make-code-save-preview`.  In the development cycle, it is a requirement to preview work locally, prior to doing a VSCode `commit` to git.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deployment Cycle.  In the deplopyment cycle, `sync-github-action-review`, it is a requirement to complete the development cycle prior to doing a VSCode `sync`.  The sync triggers github repository update.  The action starts the jekyll build to publish the website.  Any step can have errors and will require you to do a review.\n",
