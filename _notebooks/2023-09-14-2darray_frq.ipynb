    "\n",
    "- If the element at row 0 and column `col` already contains a piece of candy, then `box` is unchanged, and the method returns `true`.\n",
    "- If the element at row 0 and column `col` does not contain a piece of candy, then the method searches the remaining rows of column `col` for a piece of candy. If a piece of candy can be found in column `col`, it is moved to row 0, its previous location is set to `null`, and the method returns `true`; otherwise, the method returns `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, the grid represents the contents of `box`. An empty square in the grid is `null` in `box`. A non-empty square in the grid represents a box element that contains a `Candy` object. The string in the square of the grid indicates the flavor of the piece of candy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method call `moveCandyToFirstRow(0)` returns `false` because the box element at row 0 and column 0 does not contain a piece of candy, and there are no pieces of candy in column 0 that can be moved to row 0. The contents of `box` are unchanged.\n",

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **2D Array Representation:**\n",
    "The code utilizes a 2D array (Candy[][] candyGrid) to represent a grid-like structure resembling a box of candies, where candies can be organized in rows and columns.\n",
    "2. **Flexible Storage:**\n",
    "The 2D array allows for flexible storage and organization of candies in rows and columns, providing a structured way to hold the Candy objects within the BoxOfCandy.\n",
    "3. **Grid Manipulation:**\n",
    "The 2D array is manipulated within the BoxOfCandy class to perform actions like moving candies to the first row (moveCandyToFirstRow) and finding candies by flavor (removeNextByFlavor).\n",
    "4. **Iterating Through the Grid:**\n",
    "Loops are used to iterate through the 2D array, enabling traversal of each cell to perform operations based on the row and column indices.\n",
    "Candy Movement:\n",
    "The moveCandyToFirstRow method operates on the 2D array to move a candy from a specific column to the first row, manipulating the positions of candies within the grid.\n",
    "5. **Flavor-Based Candy Removal:**\n",
    "The removeNextByFlavor method uses the 2D array to search for candies with a specific flavor, iterating through rows and columns to find and remove the desired candy based on its flavor."
